This application simulates the irradiation of a cube (30*30*50 cm3) of liquid
water by a beam in a context of external radiotherapy. The monoenergetic source
of the beam is located at the centre of one of the faces of the cube. Particles
are emitted along the z-axis.

- Go to the folder that contains the application:

cd YorkMedPhys

- Create a working directory:

mkdir build

- Go to the working directory:

cd build

- Build the Geant4 application:

cmake ..

- Compile the application:

make

The macro particle.mac allows to modify different parameters of the beam: the type
of particle (gamma, proton, anti_proton, pi-, alpha, anti_alpha, e-, neutron, mu-),
the energy and the number of particles to be simulated. You can open and edit
the macro with atom text editor:

atom particle.mac

- Run the code:

./YorkMedPhys -m particle.mac

- Analysis of the results:

root -b analysis.C

- To quit root interactive terminal
